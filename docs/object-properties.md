# Object Properties

An OWL ObjectProperty is a construct for connecting two things in the world - e.g. part\_of links my left thumb with my left hand.

RO is primarily an ontology of Object Properties.

## Object Properties vs Relations

Sometimes following the RO 2005 paper we use the term "relation". In OWL, this largely maps to Object Properties
