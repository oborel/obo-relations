# Introduction #

We curate mappings to other resources. The current set of mappings can be found in the source directory on github:

* [src/mappings](https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations/tree/master/src/mappings)

This is an active area! See [issue 426](https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations/issues/426) for the latest

## SIO Mappings

The Semanticscience Integrated Ontology ([SIO](http://code.google.com/p/semanticscience/wiki/SIO)) provides a simple, integrated ontology of types and relations for rich description of objects, processes and their attributes.

We maintain a set of equivalence axioms connecting SIO and RO object properties here:

  * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro/bridge/sio-ro-bridge.owl

The set may not be complete - requests for additions welcome on the RO tracker.

### Differences between RO and SIO relations

The main difference between SIO relations and RO is that RO uses BFO as an upper level ontology. However, RO generally uses a fairly high level largely uncontroversial subset of BFO. The axioms linking to BFO are in a separate imported ontology that could be swapped out if need be.

See [ROAndBFO](ROAndBFO) for more details
