# Introduction #

The Semanticscience Integrated Ontology ([SIO](http://code.google.com/p/semanticscience/wiki/SIO)) provides a simple, integrated ontology of types and relations for rich description of objects, processes and their attributes.

# Details #

We maintain a set of equivalence axioms connecting SIO and RO object properties here:

  * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro/bridge/sio-ro-bridge.owl

The set may not be complete - requests for additions welcome on the RO tracker.

## Differences between RO and SIO relations ##

The main difference between SIO relations and RO is that RO uses BFO as an upper level ontology. However, RO generally uses a fairly high level largely uncontroversial subset of BFO. The axioms linking to BFO are in a separate imported ontology that could be swapped out if need be.

See [ROAndBFO](ROAndBFO) for more details
