## Usage

 * -
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001000 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) This relation is taken from the RO2005 version of RO. It may be obsoleted and replaced by relations with different definitions. See also the 'develops from' family of relations.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002150 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) The label for this relation was previously connected to. I relabeled this to "continuous with". The standard notion of connectedness does not imply shared boundaries - e.g. Glasgow connected_to Edinburgh via M8; my patella connected_to my femur (via patellar-femoral joint)
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002158 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Consider obsoleting and merging with child relation, 'in homology relationship with'
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002163 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Note that it would be possible to use the relation to label the relationship between a near infinite number of structures - between the rings of saturn and my left earlobe. The intent is that this is used for parsiomoniously for disambiguation purposes - for example, between siblings in a jointly exhaustive pairwise disjointness hierarchy
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002180 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) For use in recording has_part with a cardinality constraint, because OWL does not permit cardinality constraints to be used in combination with transitive object properties. In situations where you would want to say something like 'has part exactly 5 digit, you would instead use has_component exactly 5 digit.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002211 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Regulation does not preclude parthood; the regulatory process may be upstream, or may be within the regulated process.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002215 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) For compatibility with BFO, this relation has a shortcut definition in which the expression "capable of some P" expands to "bearer_of (some realized_by only P)".
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002222 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Do not use this relation directly. It is ended as a grouping for relations between occurrents involving the relative timing of their starts and ends.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002256 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) We place this under 'developmentally preceded by'. This placement should be examined in the context of reciprocal inductions[cjm]
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002258 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) In general you should not use this relation to make assertions - use one of the more specific relations below this one

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002379 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) This relation is added for formal completeness. It is unlikely to be used in many practical scenarios
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002400 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) This is likely to be obsoleted. A candidate replacement would be a new relation 'has bound input' or 'has substrate'

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002414 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) This is a grouping relation that should probably not be used in annotation. Consider instead the child relation 'directly provides input for' (which may later be relabeled simply to 'provides input for')
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002434 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Note that this relationship type, and sub-relationship types may be redundant with process terms from other ontologies. For example, the symbiotic relationship hierarchy parallels GO. The relations are provided as a convenient shortcut. Consider using the more expressive processual form to capture your data. In the future, these relations will be linked to their cognate processes through rules.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002440 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) We follow GO and PAMGO in using 'symbiosis' as the broad term encompassing mutualism through parasitism

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002461 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Experimental: relation used for defining interaction relations. An interaction relation holds when there is an interaction event with two partners. In a directional interaction, one partner is deemed the subject, the other the target
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002462 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Experimental: relation used for defining interaction relations; the meaning of s 'subject participant in' p is determined by the type of p, where p must be a directional interaction process. For example, in a predator-prey interaction process the subject is the predator. We can imagine a reciprocal prey-predatory process with subject and object reversed.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002463 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Experimental: relation used for defining interaction relations; the meaning of s 'target participant in' p is determined by the type of p, where p must be a directional interaction process.

Note that these entities are not necessarily contiguous - for example, the mereological sum of exons on a genome of a particular gene.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002533 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) An individual unit can be a molecular entity such as a base pair, or an abstract entity, such as the abstraction of a base pair.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002534 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) Sequence bearers can be molecular entities, such as a portion of a DNA molecule, or they can be abstract entities, such as an entity representing all human sonic hedgehog regions of the genome with a particular DNA sequence.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002535 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) This properties were created originally for the annotation of developmental or life cycle stages, such as for example Carnegie Stage 20 in humans.

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002565 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) 
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002570 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) This relation holds between a thing with a 'conduit' (e.g. a bone foramen) and a 'conduee' (for example, a nerve) such that at the time the relationship holds, the conduee has two ends sticking out either end of the conduit. It should therefore note be used for objects that move through the conduit but whose spatial extent does not span the passage. For example, it would not be used for a mountain that contains a long tunnel through which trains pass. Nor would we use it for a digestive tract and objects such as food that pass through.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002573 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) This relation is intended to be used in combination with PATO, to be able to refine PATO quality classes using modifiers such as 'abnormal' and 'normal'. It has yet to be formally aligned into an ontological framework; it's not clear what the ontological status of the "modifiers" are.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002599 [curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md) The entity c may be a molecular entity with a drug role, or it could be some other entity used in a therapeutic context, such as a hyperbaric chamber.
