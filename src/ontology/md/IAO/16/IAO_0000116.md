## Usage

 * -
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Everything is part of itself. Any part of any part of a thing is itself part of that thing. Two distinct things cannot be part of each other.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Occurrents are not subject to change and so parthood between occurrents holds for all the times that the part exists. Many continuants are subject to change, so parthood between continuants will only hold at certain times, but this is difficult to specify in OWL. See https://code.google.com/p/obo-relations/wiki/ROAndTime
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Parthood requires the part and the whole to have compatible classes: only an occurrent can be part of an occurrent; only a process can be part of a process; only a continuant can be part of a continuant; only an independent continuant can be part of an independent continuant; only an immaterial entity can be part of an immaterial entity; only a specifically dependent continuant can be part of a specifically dependent continuant; only a generically dependent continuant can be part of a generically dependent continuant. (This list is not exhaustive.)

A continuant cannot be part of an occurrent: use 'participates in'. An occurrent cannot be part of a continuant: use 'has participant'. A material entity cannot be part of an immaterial entity: use 'has location'. A specifically dependent continuant cannot be part of an independent continuant: use 'inheres in'. An independent continuant cannot be part of a specifically dependent continuant: use 'bearer of'.

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000051 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Parthood requires the part and the whole to have compatible classes: only an occurrent have an occurrent as part; only a process can have a process as part; only a continuant can have a continuant as part; only an independent continuant can have an independent continuant as part; only a specifically dependent continuant can have a specifically dependent continuant as part; only a generically dependent continuant can have a generically dependent continuant as part. (This list is not exhaustive.)

A continuant cannot have an occurrent as part: use 'participates in'. An occurrent cannot have a continuant as part: use 'has participant'.

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000062 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000052 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A dependent inheres in its bearer at all times for which the dependent exists.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000053 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A bearer can have many dependents, and its dependents can exist for different periods of time, but none of its dependents can exist when the bearer does not exist.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000057 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Has_participant is a primitive instance-level relation between a process, a continuant, and a time at which the continuant participates in some way in the process. The relation obtains, for example, when this particular process of oxygen exchange across this particular alveolar membrane has_participant this particular sample of hemoglobin at this particular time.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000079 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A function inheres in its bearer at all times for which the function exists, however the function need not be realized at all the times that the function exists.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000080 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A quality inheres in its bearer at all times for which the quality exists.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000081 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A role inheres in its bearer at all times for which the role exists, however the role need not be realized at all the times that the role exists.

A role need not be realized at all the times that the role exists.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001000 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This is a very general relation. More specific relations are preferred when applicable, such as 'directly develops from'.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001001 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This is a very general relation. More specific relations are preferred when applicable, such as 'directly develops into'. To avoid making statements about a future that may not come to pass, it is often better to use the backward-looking 'derives from' rather than the forward-looking 'derives into'.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001015 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Most location relations will only hold at certain times, but this is difficult to specify in OWL. See https://code.google.com/p/obo-relations/wiki/ROAndTime
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001018 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Containment is location not involving parthood, and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001018 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Containment obtains in each case between material and immaterial continuants, for instance: lung contained_in thoracic cavity; bladder contained_in pelvic cavity. Hence containment is not a transitive relation.    If c part_of c1 at t then we have also, by our definition and by the axioms of mereology applied to spatial regions, c located_in c1 at t. Thus, many examples of instance-level location relations for continuants are in fact cases of instance-level parthood. For material continuants location and parthood coincide. Containment is location not involving parthood, and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved. To understand this relation, we first define overlap for continuants as follows:    c1 overlap c2 at t =def for some c, c part_of c1 at t and c part_of c2 at t. The containment relation on the instance level can then be defined (see definition):
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001018 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Intended meaning:
domain: material entity
range: spatial region or site (immaterial continuant)
        
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001025 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1.    Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001025 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Most location relations will only hold at certain times, but this is difficult to specify in OWL. See https://code.google.com/p/obo-relations/wiki/ROAndTime
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002000 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A 2D boundary may have holes and gaps, but it must be a single connected entity, not an aggregate of several disconnected parts.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002000 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Although the boundary is two-dimensional, it exists in three-dimensional space and thus has a 3D shape.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002002 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) A 2D boundary may have holes and gaps, but it must be a single connected entity, not an aggregate of several disconnected parts.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002002 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Although the boundary is two-dimensional, it exists in three-dimensional space and thus has a 3D shape.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002008 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Note from NCEAS meeting: consider changing primary label
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002151 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) We would like to include disjointness axioms with part_of and has_part, however this is not possible in OWL2 as these are non-simple properties and hence cannot appear in a disjointness axiom
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002160 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) The original intent was to treat this as a macro that expands to 'in taxon' only ?Y - however, this is not necessary if we instead have supplemental axioms that state that each pair of sibling tax have a disjointness axiom using the 'in taxon' property - e.g.

 'in taxon' some Eukaryota DisjointWith 'in taxon' some Eubacteria
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002163 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) There are two ways to encode this as a shortcut relation. The other possibility to use an annotation assertion between two classes, and expand this to a disjointness axiom. 
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002178 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Individual ontologies should provide their own constraints on this abstract relation. For example, in the realm of anatomy this should hold between an artery and an anatomical structure
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002179 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Individual ontologies should provide their own constraints on this abstract relation. For example, in the realm of anatomy this should hold between a vein and an anatomical structure
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002180 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) The definition of 'has component' is still under discussion. The challenge is in providing a definition that does not imply transitivity.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002204 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) We would like to be able to express the rule: if t transcribed from g, and t is a noncoding RNA and has an evolved function, then t has gene product g.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002211 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) We use 'regulates' here to specifically imply control. However, many colloquial usages of the term correctly correspond to the weaker relation of 'causally upstream of or within' (aka influences). Consider relabeling to make things more explicit
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002214 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Experimental. In future there may be a formalization in which this relation is treated as a shortcut to some modal logic axiom. We may decide to obsolete this and adopt a more specific evolutionary relationship (e.g. evolved from)
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002214 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This property can be used to make weaker forms of certain relations by chaining an additional property. For example, we may say: retina SubClassOf has_prototype some 'detection of light'. i.e. every retina is related to a prototypical retina instance which is detecting some light. Note that this is very similar to 'capable of', but this relation affords a wider flexibility. E.g. we can make a relation between continuants.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002218 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This may be obsoleted and replaced by the original 'has agent' relation
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002220 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This relation acts as a join point with BSPO
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002258 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) false
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002285 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This relation is intended for cases such as when we have a bone element replacing its cartilage element precursor. Currently most AOs represent this using 'develops from'. We need to decide whether 'develops from' will be generic and encompass replacement, or whether we need a new name for a generic relation that encompasses replacement and development-via-cell-lineage
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002291 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Revisit this term after coordinating with SO/SOM. The domain of this relation should be a sequence, as an instance of a DNA molecule is only expressed in the cell of which it is a part.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002295 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This property and its subproperties are being used primarily for the definition of GO developmental processes. The property hierarchy mirrors the core GO hierarchy. In future we may be able to make do with a more minimal set of properties, but due to the way GO is currently structured we require highly specific relations to avoid incorrect entailments. To avoid this, the corresponding genus terms in GO should be declared mutually disjoint.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002314 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Because part_of is transitive, inheres in is a sub-relation of inheres in part of
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002322 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) An experimental relation currently used to connect a feature possessed by an organism (e.g. anatomical structure, biological process, phenotype or quality) to a habitat or environment in which that feature is well suited, adapted or provides a reproductive advantage for the organism. For example, fins to an aquatic environment. Usually this will mean that the structure is adapted for this environment, but we avoid saying this directly - primitive forms of the structure may not have evolved specifically for that environment (for example, early wings were not necessarily adapted for an aerial environment). Note also that this is a statement about the general class of structures - not every instance of a limb need confer an advantage for a terrestrial environment, e.g. if the limb is vestigial.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002326 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) We would like to say

if and only if
 exists c', p'
  c part_of c' and c' capable_of p
   and
  c capable_of p' and p' part_of p
then
 c contributes_to p

However, this is not possible in OWL. We instead make this relation a sub-relation of the two chains, which gives us the inference in the one direction.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002410 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.

To define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:

 * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? 
 * Is the causal relation regulatory?
 * Is the influence positive or negative

The first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.

For the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.

For the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.

Each of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002413 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This is currently called 'directly provides input for' to be consistent with our terminology where we use 'direct' whenever two occurrents succeed one another directly. We may relabel this simply 'provides input for', as directness is implicit
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002418 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) We would like to make this disjoint with 'preceded by', but this is prohibited in OWL2
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002420 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) The domain for this class can be considered to be owl:Class, but we cannot assert this in OWL2-DL

Some kinds of pollination may be semibiotic - e.g. wind can have the role of pollinator. We would use a separate relation for this.

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002503 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This relation is provided in order to support the use of relational qualities such as 'concentration of'; for example, the concentration of C in V is a quality that inheres in V, but pertains to C.
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002504 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) This is a very strong relation. Often we will not have enough evidence to know for sure that there are no species within a lineage that lack the structure - loss is common in evolution. However, there are some statements we can make with confidence - no vertebrate lineage could persist without a brain or a heart. All primates are limbed. 
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002506 [editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) The intent is that the process branch of the causal property hierarchy is primary (causal relations hold between occurrents/processes), and that the material branch is defined in terms of the process branch

Restricted to linking biological systems and phenomena?  Inclusive of only diseases in range, or broader?
