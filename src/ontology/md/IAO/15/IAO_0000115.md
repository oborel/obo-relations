## Elucidation

This is used when the statement/axiom is assumed to hold true 'eternally'

## How to interpret (informal)

First the "atemporal" FOL is derived from the OWL using the standard
interpretation. This axiom is temporalized by embedding the axiom
within a for-all-times quantified sentence. The t argument is added to
all instantiation predicates and predicates that use this relation.

## Example

    Class: nucleus
    SubClassOf: part_of some cell

    forall t :
      forall n :
        instance_of(n,Nucleus,t)
         implies
        exists c :
          instance_of(c,Cell,t)
          part_of(n,c,t)

## Notes

This interpretation is *not* the same as an at-all-times relation


 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001902 [definition](../../IAO/15/IAO_0000115.md) 

## Elucidation

This is used when the first-order logic form of the relation is
binary, and takes no temporal argument.

## Example:

    Class: limb
    SubClassOf: develops_from some lateral-plate-mesoderm

     forall t, t2:
      forall x :
        instance_of(x,Limb,t)
         implies
        exists y :
          instance_of(y,LPM,t2)
          develops_from(x,y)
