 * *[definition](../../IAO/15/IAO_0000115.md)* = A is spatially_disjoint_from B if and only if they have no parts in common
 * *[editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md)* = There are two ways to encode this as a shortcut relation. The other possibility to use an annotation assertion between two classes, and expand this to a disjointness axiom.

 * *[curator note](../../IAO/32/IAO_0000232.md)* = Note that it would be possible to use the relation to label the relationship between a near infinite number of structures - between the rings of saturn and my left earlobe. The intent is that this is used for parsiomoniously for disambiguation purposes - for example, between siblings in a jointly exhaustive pairwise disjointness hierarchy
