## Class : developmentally induced by

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002256
 * *Label* = developmentally induced by
 * *Definition* = t1 induced_by t2 if there is a process of developmental induction (GO:0031128) with t1 and t2 as interacting participants. t2 causes t1 to change its fate from a precursor anatomical structure type T to T', where T' develops_from T
