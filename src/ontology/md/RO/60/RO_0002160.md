 * *[editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md)* = The original intent was to treat this as a macro that expands to 'in taxon' only ?Y - however, this is not necessary if we instead have supplemental axioms that state that each pair of sibling tax have a disjointness axiom using the 'in taxon' property - e.g.

 'in taxon' some Eukaryota DisjointWith 'in taxon' some Eubacteria
