 * *[editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md)* = A 2D boundary may have holes and gaps, but it must be a single connected entity, not an aggregate of several disconnected parts.
 * *[editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md)* = Although the boundary is two-dimensional, it exists in three-dimensional space and thus has a 3D shape.
