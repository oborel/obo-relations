= Introduction =

Representing complex descriptions using a limited set of relations is possible, but unwieldy and complex. Some formalisms such as OBO and simple graph formalisms require the ontology to a graph with labeled nodes.

Shortcut relations can be used in place of multiple relations and classes.

= Details =

Shortcut or macro relations are described in [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/oboformat/spec.html#7 section 7 of the oboformat spec], although in fact they are designed primarily as OWL->OWL translations.


= Examples =

= Implementation =

Available as part of

 * [http://code.google.com/p/oboformat] basic reference obo2owl converter
 * [http://code.google.com/p/owltools/wiki/OortIntro Oort] the OBO ontology release tool

Note that Oort can take OWL ontologies as input. It gives you the option of expanding macros in place (replacement strategy) or generating a separate external ontology of General Class Inclusion (GCI) axioms
